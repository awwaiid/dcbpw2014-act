There are feeders from various airports and Amtrak trains into the metro rail system. It is also accessible on the 70/79 and S2/S4 bus lines from DC, plus a number of Ride-On buses from Montgomery County. <a href="http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/mcgtmpl.asp?url=/content/DOT/projects/sstc/index.asp">Info on busses here</a>.

<p>
The county runs municipal parking garages that are free on evenings, weekends, and holidays.  The nearest parking garage is called the "Town Hall" garage, and is across the street from the SSCB.  If the Town Hall garage is full, the Wayne Avenue and Spring-Colesville garages are within a couple minutes' walk. <a href="http://www.silverspringdowntown.com/transportation/parking/parking-garages">Here is a list of local parking</a>.
